						As a developer I am on a never-ending quest of learning, my natural curiosity make me seek out new skills and ways of doing things. I am a quick learner who picks up on the basics of new systems, frameworks or languages.
					</p>
					<p>
						Working in web development never seemed to be in the cards for me, despite having an interest in computers and the web I did not imagine me being able to work with code or programming. 
						I have always had a hard time figuring out what to do with my life and what kind of work I wanted to do.
						An interest in language and communication brought me on a trip to university where I was introduced to the world of web design. 
						It grabbed my interest, but it wasn't until I enrolled in Multimedia Design and Communication that I got my hands on the first bits of code. At the risk of sounding dramatic, it changed everything. 
						I was hooked, and it was suddenly clear what I wanted to work with and do in life.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have two primary drivers, and aspects that has caught my interest. One is the seemingly unending oppotunities to learn and discover. There is always a new tool, property or technique to learn, and I get an immense satisfaction from acquiring new knowledge. The second thing I have come to appreciate a great deal in working on web pages or apps, is the 'aha' moments, when the light-bulb goes on as I find a solution to a bug or figure out a better way to accomplish a task.
					</p>
					<p>
						My educational background has been more focused on styling. design and ensuring a strong connection between those and the message that will be communicated. My strengths in that regard are around making highly user-friendly solutions. After graduating I have put a greater emphasis on the more programming heavy aspects of development, and have specifically focused on improving my JavaScript skills.
